5. **Code Review**: Reviewers examine the PR, provide feedback, and request changes.
6. **Address Feedback**: Make necessary revisions and push updates.
7. **Merge the PR**: Once approved, the PR is merged into the target branch.
8. **Delete the Branch**: Optionally, delete the branch after merging.


## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?


**Forking** a repository on GitHub involves creating a personal copy of someone else's repository under your own GitHub account. This allows you to experiment with changes without affecting the original project. 

Differences Between Forking and Cloning

- **Forking**:
  - **Purpose**: Forking creates a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account, enabling you to contribute back to the original project through pull requests.
  - **Location**: The forked repository is hosted on GitHub, separate from the original.
  - **Collaboration**: Changes made in your fork can be proposed to the original repository by submitting a pull request.
  
- **Cloning**:
  - **Purpose**: Cloning downloads a local copy of a repository to your computer, allowing you to work on it offline.
  - **Location**: The cloned repository is stored locally on your machine.
  - **Collaboration**: Cloning is typically used for local development, but any changes made must be pushed back to a GitHub repository, which may be your fork or the original repository if you have push access.

 Scenarios Where Forking is Particularly Useful

1. **Contributing to Open Source Projects**:
   - Forking is the standard approach when you want to contribute to open source projects. You can make changes in your fork and submit pull requests to the original repository.

2. **Experimenting with Changes**:
   - If you want to experiment with substantial changes to a project without affecting the original, forking allows you to do so safely. You can try new features or refactor code in your fork.

3. **Maintaining a Personal Copy of a Project**:
   - If you find a project useful but want to maintain your own version with custom modifications or additions, forking allows you to do this while staying updated with the original repository.



## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

**GitHub Issues** and **Project Boards** are crucial for tracking bugs, managing tasks, and organizing projects.

 GitHub Issues:
